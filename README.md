## [FRC Team 102 The Gearheads](https://team102.org/)'s robot code for the 2022 FIRST Robotics Competition - Rapid React

We use a [WPILib command-based robot](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/commandbased/what-is-command-based.html), so our code is split up into subsystems and commands.

### Notable features
These are some of the most important or interesting parts of our robot code this year:
* [Swerve drive](src/main/cpp/subsystems/SwerveDrive.cpp)
* [Closed-loop shooter control](src/main/cpp/subsystems/Shooter.cpp)
* [Limelight](src/main/cpp/subsystems/Limelight.cpp)
* [Shooter hood](src/main/cpp/subsystems/ShooterHood.cpp)
* [Autonomous routine](src/main/cpp/commands/Autonomous/MainAutonomous.cpp)
